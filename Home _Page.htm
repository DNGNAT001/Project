<p align="left"> Computer security, also known as cyber security or IT security, is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. Before anyone can make implementation of computer security, they first have to understand whta are the basic components of computer system that have to be protected.</p> 
        
<p>The following are the main components of a computer system;</p>    
<h2><li>Hardware</li></h2>.<p>This the physical/tangible aspect of computers, telecommunications, and other devices. Security of hardware is vital to eliminate theft and damage.</p>
<h2><li>Software</li></h2>. <p>This is the part of a computer system that consists of data or computer instructions. Software must be protected in order to minimize data loss,to maintain efficiency and also lessen the chances of viruses. </p>

<p>Both these components are at risk, therefore Computer Security is an important factor.</p>
